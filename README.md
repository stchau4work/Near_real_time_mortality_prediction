## Executive Summary

Pooling and calculating premium from historical mortality data has always been an important methodology for insurance company to price their premium.  Despite the good reference data published from The Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME), which contain annual county-level age-standardized mortality rates for 21 mutually exclusive causes of death from 1980 to 2014, the frequency of the data makes it hard to make any just-in-time, concise and competitive decision. 


Recognising this issue, a prototype is introduced to rely on soft & high frequency data set to supplement the 'lag' between each publications and hence insurance companies could not only get a near real time profile for the mortality in the industry but also it can help better lower the risk and hence more competitive premium offer to Life and Health insurance products such as Term Life or even extend it to critical illness suite in the future.
