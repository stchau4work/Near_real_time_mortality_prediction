## Executive Summary

Pooling and calculating premium from historical data has always been an important methodology for insurance companies to price their products.  Despite the good reference from data published, such as [The Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME)](http://ghdx.healthdata.org/record/united-states-mortality-rates-county-1980-2014), which contain annual county-level age-standardized mortality rates for 21 mutually exclusive causes of death from 1980 to 2014, the frequency of the dataset makes it hard, if not possible to make any just-in-time commercial decision. 

## Solutions - New Analytic Engine

Recognising this issue, a prototype (near real time mortality prediction) analytic engine is introduced to base on soft & high frequency data to supplement the 'lag' between each publication


## Better Track of the Risk Profile

Insurance companies could better understand their risk profile for the estimated mortality rate in the next publication. This gain in accuracy and time can yield a substantial benefit in making all kinds of decision especially in this competitive business environment. 


## Make Insurance Cheaper

In this case, Insurance Companies can price more aggressively to the target customers for life insurance products such as [Term Insurance](https://www.prudential.com/personal/life-insurance/find-life-insurance-policy/term-life-products) as now they have more confidence in reduce the price of the premium and then boost the volume. 

## Extensibility 

Lastly, the analytic engine can also extend to any products which is not benefit from the high frequency dataset, for instance, predicting flu claims.
